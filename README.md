**Project Objective:**
The Coronavirus pandemic has impacted the world in numerous ways, and one of the most observable changes is the expanded accentuation on private defensive gear, for example, facial coverings. Masks are known to be one of the best ways of forestalling the spread of the infection, and they are currently expected in numerous public spots all over the planet. Be that as it may, authorizing Mask wearing can be trying in jam-packed places like air terminals, public transportation, and shopping centers.

**Methodology:**
To resolve this issue, an answer proposed is to utilize AI for Mask recognition. By utilizing PC vision innovation, conceivable to foster an application can identify regardless of whether an individual is wearing a Mask progressively. This can assist with guaranteeing that individuals keep wellbeing rules and lessen the gamble of infection transmission.

The innovation utilized for this arrangement is AI, explicitly PC vision. The app is built using Flask, a micro web framework written in Python that is used for building web applications.  The application takes an image as input, either by capturing it using the phone camera or uploading an existing image. The picture is then handled utilizing PC vision calculations to distinguish regardless of whether an individual is wearing a Mask. The AI model utilized in this application is prepared on a dataset of pictures that contain individuals wearing masks and not wearing masks. The model has figured out how to perceive the elements that recognize these two classes and can arrange new pictures with high precision.

The application can be utilized in different settings, from private ventures to huge public spaces. It can assist with guaranteeing that individuals are observing security rules and decrease the gamble of infection transmission. By utilizing AI for Mask detection, it is feasible to mechanize the interaction and make it more productive than manual checks. The application can likewise be incorporated with different frameworks, like surveillance cameras, to give constant observing of Mask consistence.

**Result:**
In conclusion, Mask Detection utilizing AI is a powerful answer for the issue of implementing mask-wearing in packed places. By utilizing PC vision innovation and a profound learning calculation, conceivable to foster an application can distinguish regardless of whether an individual is wearing a mask progressively.
